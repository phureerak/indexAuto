Yesterday in China, HMD Global announced the newest member of its range of Nokia branded Android smartphones.
We've seen the wallet-friendly Nokia 3 and 5, the mid-range Nokia 6, and most recently came the flagship Nokia 8.
While it might appear that HMD doesn't know how to count, the Nokia 7 announcement at least takes us one step closer to a full house.
The Nokia 2 and 9 are on the way soon, too.The Nokia 7 follows the same pleasing design language as its siblings, but where the Nokia 8 was encased in metal,
this new phone goes for a mixture, with an aluminum frame and a vacuum molded back made from Corning Gorilla Glass which curves nicely around the back.
The display is a manageable 5.2", although there are sizeable bezels on the forehead and chin, just as with the Nokia 8.
